This is a project I made for personal use. The project consists of a simple finance control system.
In the project you have a monthly view of your debts and income, and you can control your bills and monthly balances.

The project was made with the objective of learning the technologies used.

Technologies used:

- Java / Spring boot
- Thymeleaf
- HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
- MYSQL
- Deployment in Heroku

The project is simple and needs a lot of improvements, but it was worth the learning.
